Short It Out is a Brain Training game which provides user with a board with M*N grids. Randomly some boxes are placed on the grids for the game to start. 

A user can select from any one box and start the game. He/she needs to connect the selected box to any of the other box which user thinks would be appropriate to connect to achieve shortest path.

The steps needs to be followed to connect remaining boxes.
